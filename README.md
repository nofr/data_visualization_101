## General Info
The project was conducted in a `Python 3.8` environment. 

Here we will present different ways to correctly present and analyze data, while getting as much information out of it. 

In this project we will get acquitted with the well-known `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, python plotting modules. 
Additionally, we will introduce other analysis and plotting python tools, such as the widely-familiar `plotly`.

## Files
* _**ipynb files**:_ The ipython notebooks contain the information that was presented in correlated 
Medium blog posts + additional explanations and elaborated optional functionality (with examples).  
Although it is not usually the best practice to upload notebook files directly to remote repo, 
I thought it might be more comfortable for users that want to inspect the notebook content briefly.


* _**python files**:_ ipython notebook files that were converted to python files - 
mainly for users who will clone the project. 


* _**csv & xls files**:_ same as for .ipynb, it is not a good practice to upload such files 
(mainly in cases where they contain sensitive info + they are heavy), 
but in this case I made an exception, in order to make the project more accessible and user-friendly. 
Uploading the data sets would probably be useful for users that would want to check that they are 
getting the exact same results as I did in the articles mentioned above.
